In this turorial, I'll show you how to design a sewing pattern on the Freesewing platform.

## Things you should know before we start

### You'll be writing code

Freesewing is a software project, and the pattern we are going to design will be a small _module_ that plugs into it.

>_If you've never written any code, don't panic. We'll take it one step at a time._

### What is a pattern?

We'll be designing a _recipe_ for a pattern that people can add their ingredients to. Those ingredients will be measurements and options.

For the sake of simplicity, when we talk about designing a pattern, we are designing the pattern recipe.

### Connecting the dots

Designing sewing patterns is a matter of connecting the dots. Traditionally, you'd start out with a large sheet of paper, mark a point somewhere, then measure down to the next point, sideways to yet another point, and so on. 

In the end, you draw lines and curves to connect these _points_, and you have your pattern.

Good news, we'll be doing exactly the same thing. Just not on paper, but in code.

### Patterns are made up of parts

Sewing patterns are typically made up of different parts. The front, the back, the sleeve, and so on. A pattern is not much more than a bunch of parts grouped together on a page.

### Things you should know: Summary

Ok, by now you've learned that:

- [x] you'll be writing code
- [x] you'll be making a pattern recipe, to which people can add measurements and options
- [x] a pattern is made up of pattern parts
- [x] we'll be adding points and connecting them with lines and curves

## Kicking the tires
