Freesewing is a free and open source platform to generate sewing patterns. 

## Where to start?

If you are new to Freesewing, you might want to read [about](about/) this project.

If you already know what this is about, you can jump right into the heading below that is most relevant to you.

### For pattern designers

If you are a pattern designer, you'll want to learn how to design patterns on/for freesewing. You should start by reading [the pattern design tutorial](designer/tutorial/), and then create your first pattern.

When you have any questions, the designer reference should hold all the answers.

### For developers

Hi there. If you'd like to join the Freesewing effort, here's some info to get your started:

- You can join the chat at our Slack channel. You'll need an invite, so email me to get one.
- You can fork the code on GitHub
- There is hand-crafted documentation of the public Freesewing API
- And there is auto-generated documentation of the entire Freesewing API

If you're new to Freesewing and like to get involved, a good place to start is this walkthrough of a Freesewing API request.

### For pattern companies

Just because we have open source sewing patterns doesn't mean there's no room for people to earn a living designing sewing patterns. Much to the contrary, I would like to see more designers sell patterns, and I hope that Freesewing can help them do so.

If you're interested in using Freesewing in your business, get in touch. I'd be happy to help out.

### For system administrators

If you want to run your own Freesewing instance, you'll want to look at the installation and configuration instructions.

### For everybody else

Freesewing is a software project, infused with a dose of sewing pattern design.

If those domains are not your forte, you might want to visit freesewing.org instead. That is where we give out the patterns. This place is for people who want to know how the sausage is made.
