Freesewing is a rewrite of the MakeMyPattern.com backend.

MakeMyPattern.com (mmp) is a website that generates sewing patterns based on your measurements.

Freesewing is the successor of the mmp backend, whereas the freesewing.org website will become the successor of the MakeMyPattern.com website.

## MakeMyPattern.com: Custom sewing patterns without the hassle

Nothing beats the feeling of wearing something you made yourself. But making clothes takes hard work, and for the best results, you need a good pattern.

Hand-drafted patterns are the best, but demand a lot of time and effort. I wanted to change that, and that effort evolved into MakeMyPattern.com.

## Freesewing.org: Same, but different. And free in every way

Freesewing does everything MMP does, and more. In addition, all the code is open source.

> _If you're interested, I wrote about my reasons for starting this project in [my guest post on opensource.com](https://opensource.com/life/16/11/free-open-sewing-patterns)._

What Freesewing does is comparable to what Lekala and Bootstrap Fashion do: provide customized sewing patterns.

There's one important difference though: Freesewing is free of charge, the patterns are free (licensed as CC-BY) and our code is free (licensed as GPL-3).

## Wait, what's the catch?

There is none, because this is not a business and it's not about making money.

Freesewing is a labour of love.
