Trouser patterns:
1. Make the back pleat aware of the rise.  When positioning the two

2. Alter the back pocket slit to be more parallel to the waist line
when there is rise added to the back.

Hoodie pattern:
1. Make it longer

Boxer pattern:
1. Side seam length
2. Rise not taken into account

A-Shirt pattern:
1. US size 44 sample breaks because it wants Freesewing\\Polynomial::getQuadraticRoots() which is not implemented
