Check for improvements in boxer pattern. Rise is not used, plus seam length does not match
Only use naturalWaist, hips, and seat for circumference in the waist/bum area
Make demo select default option in dropdown (chooseOne)
Hood opening replaced with head circumference
Create compare service which is draft+sample
Make missing measurements/options fall back to defaults (in channel?)
Rework config files for other patterns, see AaronAshirt
Viewbox seems broken
Include measurements in sampler files from parent patterns
