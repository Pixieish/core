Update measurement names in frontend
Filter out overlap in path offset
Write a better packer
Subtheme defs don't seem to be taken into account
Curve does not correctly set bounding box (try with single curve part)
Check for improvements in boxer pattern. Rise is not used, plus seam length does not match
Remove 'circumference' from measurements
Only use naturalWaist, hips, and seat for circumference in the waist/bum area
Compare position of prefix parametner in addSplitCurve and curveCrossesX. Consistent?
